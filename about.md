Hey there.
I'm Nithun Harikrishnan, a developer currently living in Chicago. I have a bachelors degree in Biotechnology and I am currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science from DePaul University, Chicago.

Previously I worked at a Fortune 50 Pharma Company, then moved on to startup Unmonkey.com, an E-commerce firm and recently worked at Machine learning based healthcare startup.

I love to build software that makes a difference. I have an instinct for good design and constant desire to be better.
