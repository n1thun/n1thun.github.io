Nanodiary is a minimal personal diary application for android. This application was built by me for the Android development course at DePaul University. You can find the source code at [github](https://github.com/nithunx/Nanodiary).

### Features include:
* User creation and authentication.
* Create and save entries to the cloud.
* Add, crop and store images to the cloud.
