![Welcome to the Jungle]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/webmap.png)
The most important thing you have to keep in mind when you teach yourself how to code is not to freak out, Its true that its a jungle out there but the entire process can be greatly simplified if you follow a proper of roadmap of what to learn and when. When I started to learn about web development there was this flurry of tech jargon I had to make sense of before I could get any actual work done.  This blog post aims to help others who are headed down the same road navigate more easily.


## The Process:
Start simple, just focus on learning the core concepts and how to utilize them, build small projects which incorporate these concepts. Don't even try to learn everything about each topic at this point, it is futile. The only way you can become a good developer is by practice, set aside at least an hour a day to code and do it religiously. Your aim should be to get ur self up and running but also have a firm grasp on core concepts. You will face many hurdles while learning to code, your code might not work, your might be using the wrong version of the program, etc. Google is your best friend here, even seasoned developer will get stuck at certain junctures. It is part of the process, do not get disheartened. Take a break and get back to it. Everything is hard before its easy.


## The Roadmap:
I don't think there is one perfect way to go about leaning to code but, I feel this should get you started on the right path. It should be fairly easy to learn most of the concepts concurrently, but I suggest you learn the first 2 levels sequentially.

### Level 1
* Linux/Mac Terminal basics
* HTML
* CSS (Cascading style sheets)
* JavaScript
* Git basics
* FTP
* SSH
* Deployment basics
* Bootstrap
* LESS/SASS

### Level 2
* Programming language (Ruby/Python/JavaScript - Pick one)
* Data Structures
* Algorithms
* Design Patterns
* Servers (Nginx/Apache)
* Databases (MySQL)
* Deployment techniques (AWS/Heroku/etc)

### Level 3
* Advanced front-end frameworks
* Test driven development techniques
* Security services
* RESTful APIs

## Resources:
There are tons of tutorials available online and it never been easier to learn to code. You can see a list of my most favorite ones below, I do feel that some of the  paid services are much better than the free ones because they keep the resources updated and help is always at hand.
